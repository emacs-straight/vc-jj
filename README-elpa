1.1 Contributing
────────────────

  We welcome bug reports and pull requests!  Since `vc-jj.el' is
  distributed via GNU elpa, non-trivial code contributions need to have
  the standard FSF copyright assignment in place.


1.2 Jujutsu configuration hints
───────────────────────────────

  Emacs has built-in support for git-style diff and conflict markers, so
  you might want to set the following options in your Jujutsu
  configuration, for example via `jj config edit --user' or `jj config
  edit --repo':

  ┌────
  │ [ui]
  │ diff.format = "git"
  │ conflict-marker-style = "git"
  └────
